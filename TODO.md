# Plan for DP3

## Doc

- write more about:
- drift (one more lib)
- experiments
- add formal components (conclusion, eval, technical docs,...)

## Code

- refactor model retraining
  - hyperparam search, grid search
  - parallel execution where applicable
  - early stopping
- split models (PMs together, NO2 separately)
- transformers (newer experimental ones)
- data drift -> at least one more lib -> comparison -> in pdf as well
